# Sound Effect Bot for Discord

Play sound effects in a Discord voice channel.

## How to use:

- Add music files into the folder soundeffects/

In Discord:

- Enter a voice channel
- Write and send !se into any text channel and the bot will play a random sound effect
- Write and send !se "name" to play a specific sound effect

## Setup:

- Create a Bot at https://discord.com/developers/ and give it permissions to write chat messages and use voice channels
- This article on [Medium](https://medium.com/better-programming/coding-a-discord-bot-with-python-64da9d6cade7) helped me a lot.
- Install the Discord.py dependency (requirements.txt)
- Enter the your generated token you have from the Discord Developer Website in token.txt
- Invite the bot to your Discord Channel
- run main.py
